# Anomaly detection

Anomaly detection on a production line using principal component analysis (PCA) and kernel principal component analysis (KPCA).

## Quick preview

- _Authors_: Sylvain Combettes, Houssam L'Ghoul
- _Date_: Oct. 2018 - June 2019
- _Context_: For our penultimate-year project at Mines Nancy (half a day per week), we did research for the French company [Saint-Gobain](https://www.saint-gobain.com/en), the European or worldwide leader in all of its businesses (mainly construction materials). In 2018, Saint-Gobain had a â‚¬41.8 billion turnover, operated in 67 countries and had more than 180,000 employees.
- _Topic_: Detection of sensor failure in a production line.
- _Methods_: Principal component analysis (PCA) and kernel principal component analysis (KPCA).
- _Programming_: MATLAB.
- _Result_: the algorithm can detect 100% of the failure days observed by Saint-Gobain.
- _Links_: [report incoming]

## To note

- I was only able to publish one fourth of the total project, the rest being confidential.
- The MATLAB scripts are commented in French. 
- The report (uploaded soon) is in French.
